Problem Statement:
To understand user preferences and behavior on Netflix and provide recommendations to improve content offerings

Insights:
1.  Most of the movies and TV shows added to Netflix are that released after the year 2010


2.  Highest number of movies and Tv shows belongs to the country United states followed by India.


3. It is observed that movies duration range is between 90-100 mins.


4. It is observed that most tv-shows have 1 season



5. Top 10 actors who have appeared in most movies or TV shows



6. Top 10 directors who have appeared in most movies or TV shows



7.  Which genre movies are more popular or produced more


8. 
 Correlation between number of days between the release date and when it was added to Netflix indicates a strong negative linear relationship between these two variables.
 When Release year increases (i.e., as movies get older), the 'day to Netflix' decreases significantly.
 In other words, newer movies tend to be added to Netflix more quickly after their release.


Recommendation
We can focus on acquiring recent content post-2010, balancing it with classic titles.
Movies from the United States and India can be added more due to popularity.
We can Offer series with multiple seasons to engage users over a longer period since most of the TV series has one season.
We can Enhance content recommendation algorithms for popular genres like Action, Adventure, Dramas, and Comedies.
Encourage user interactions (ratings, reviews, watchlists) to improve recommendation accuracy and engagement.
